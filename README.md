# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


### ToDo:
1. Setup a socket server for 2-3 player connection - done
2. Add title.
3. Allow players to put their names - done
4. Seperate single player and socket functionality in the frontend with react.
5. Fix publishing the other buttons
6. Quatrain UI? 
7. Redis DB
8. Node JS / GUnicorn+NginX backend

### Multiplayer:
1. Change messages to haikus, people cannot send messages.
2. Limit the haiku count to 5 lines (from the server).
3. Wouldn't need to store the haikus on the frontend.
